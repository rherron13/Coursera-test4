  <h1> Author <div> Raven Herron </div> </h1>
  <p> I would like to introduce myself! My name is Raven, and this is my very first web development project. I decided to start this project in order to practice skills in the areas of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My first career is working as a teacher in the are of elementary education. Teaching is a passion of mine. I love to help my students develop into the best people that they can be. I always tell them to be great and encourage them to grow. This year I have decided to take my own advice and aspire to be great. I have always had an interest in computers and learning how to code. I have been a afraid to take the first steps to learning out of fear of failure. I am so excited that I've broken away from that fear, and I hope that coding will take me to places that I have never been before. I hope that you are able to gain something from everything that I share. Enjoy, and remember to always be great! <div> -Raven </div> </p>
